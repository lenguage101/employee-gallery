# Employee Gallery Design

## Purpose

To create a responsive employee gallery that incorporates a lightbox effect when clicks or touched on.<br />
There are three breakpoints to correspond for mobile, tablet, and desktop. <br />

## Desktop 
<img src="images/desktop-version.JPG" />

## Tablet & Mobile

<img src="images/tablet-version.JPG" />
<img src="images/mobile-version.JPG" />

## Lightbox

<img src="images/lightbox.JPG" />

The data is fetched from the random user api. <br />
The gallery will display the employee picture, name, email, and city of resident while the modal will provide much greater detail around the individual. <br />
To exit, simple click or tap outside the modal <br />
